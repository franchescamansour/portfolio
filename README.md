You can call me frankie, or franchy, or coco. I was basically born with creativity in my blood. I love anything to do with art, and grew up thriving to impress others with my work. Which is why I chose to be a Graphic Designer. The perfect solution of creativity, skills and business. I love turning ideas, into a reality.
